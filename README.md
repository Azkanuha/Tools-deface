# WebDAV File Uploader (auto-deface)

WebDAV File Uploader (auto-deface) is a simple tool that allows you to upload HTML files to various URLs using Curl. This tool comes with information about the developer and social media links, and it allows you to perform simple defacement by uploading your HTML script. I must emphasize that tools like this are intended for educational and learning purposes only. As the creator of the script, I will not be responsible for any misuse of this tool.

## Requirements
Please place your HTML file in the Internal storage or a directory as shown below:

```
/storage/emulated/0/file.html
```
